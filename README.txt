One of my proudest projects. Complex React.JS project that includes using backtracking algorithms I wrote to solve and create random sudoku boards.
The final app is a fully functioning front end sudoku game with every feature of sudoku:
-customize the difficulty based on the number of empty cells to start
-choose between easy mode (incorrect placements are shown) and hard mode
-highlights all cells of the value in focus
-Note taking option
-Undo moves and clear
-Clean CSS for a user-friendly experience
